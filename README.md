# Ren'Py Chat Log Exmaple

***An example to demonstrate the [Ren'Py Chat Log Library](https://github.com/JimTheCactus/chatlogging)***

This example demonstrates the chat log library with the library imported as a submodule. To use this you'll need to do the following steps:

* Clone this repository using `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JimTheCactus/chatlogging-example.git` in your Ren'Py projects folder.
  * See [git-submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) and the [Git Book discussion on submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for more information on cloning repositories with submodules.
* Open Ren'Py however it is you do.
* Select the chatlog-example project.
* Mash that `Launch Project` button *so hard*.

The actual scripts are in the `game/scripts` folder. Chatlogging
itself is included as a submodule at `game/scripts/chatlogging`.

No reason to make this needlessly hard. To use this in your own work, do the following:

* Put `Chat log script by PoorLifeChoices` (lol :3) or `Chat log script by John-Michael O'Brien` in your credits.
* Use the thing.
* Love the thing.
* Make a million dollars from your thing with my thing.
* It ain't my fault if the thing breaks something important.

However, I formally have to be more specific, so legalese ho!
